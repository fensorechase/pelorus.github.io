# Air Travel With Type 1 Diabetes
#### Author: Anjali Prabhakaran


Travelling is no small feat - between hotel logistics, packing lists, and flight details, a vacation is usually preceded by hours of planning and stress. Type 1 diabetes often only makes this process harder, given the additional equipment and tasks necessary for taking care of oneself. If you are struggling to figure out how to tackle this process, then keep reading to learn how to best handle air travel with T1D!

## 1. Pack extra supplies and medication! 
You never know what unexpected travel delays may occur, or the availability of extra supplies at your destination. I try to pack enough supplies to last at least 20-50% longer than the duration of my trip. 

## 2. Research your destination! 
If you are traveling internationally, make sure to understand how the hospital system works and if you need any traveler’s insurance. It can also be helpful to locate the closest hospital and pharmacy from where you are staying.


## 3. Bring a doctor's note! 
I usually carry a doctor's note with me for any situation that might involve a security screening, such as concerts, amusement parks, and airports. I ask my doctor to write a letter detailing my medical condition, listing my prescriptions, describing what to do in case of a medical emergency, and printed on the hospital letterhead. This way, you are prepared if any questions arise. 

## 4. Pack all medication separately! 
Before going through airport security, declare all of your medication and diabetes supplies, and separate them from your other belongings before screening begins. Pack these supplies in a clear, sealable bag. You can show the security agent your doctor's note at this point as well. 

## 5. Pack supplies in separate bags! 
To avoid loss or theft, I try my best to take all of my medical supplies in my hand luggage. I also try to spread my supplies across multiple bags as well to be extra safe, in case one bag is compromised.

Here is some more detailed information on how to take different diabetes medical supplies and equipment through airport security and on-board.

## 1. Insulin: 
Despite the rule prohibiting liquids in containers greater than 3.4oz, this rule does not apply to insulin, or other diabetes medications. Make sure to always take insulin in hand luggage, not checked luggage, to prevent pressure and temperature changes in luggage holds from freezing your insulin. You may also want to bring a cooling pouch to carry your insulin.

## 2. Syringes: 
An unlimited amount of unused syringes are permitted if they are 1. accompanied by insulin and 2. packed in a sharps container or another hard-surfaced container.

## 3. Insulin pump and supplies (cleaning agents, tubing, batteries, needle, catheter): 
These are all permitted if accompanied by insulin. Pumps cannot be exposed to x-rays, so do not take them through hand luggage scanners, hold luggage scanners, or full body scanners. Ask to walk through a metal detector instead, or opt for a pat down.

## 4. CGMs: 
Similar to pumps, avoid exposing CGMs to x-rays, and use a walk-through metal detector or pat-down for a security check.

## 5. Other liquid medications (glucagon, glucose gels, etc.): 
Liquid medications are also exempt from the 3.4oz rule. However, for ease of travel, you may want to consider non-liquid alternatives when possible, such as glucose tablets or powders.
