# 4 Tips to Manage CGM Irritation
#### Author: Anjali Prabhakaran


A continuous glucose monitor is one of the most useful tools to help manage your diabetes. However, the irritation, itchiness, and rashes that can accompany wearing a CGM are anything but pleasant. Much of the irritation that occurs when adhesives are applied to the skin can be alleviated by properly hydrating your skin and making sure your skin barrier is preserved. Here are four tips to help take care of your skin while wearing your sensor. 

## 1. Keep Your Skin Moisturized
Before applying your sensor, make sure to regularly apply lotion to frequently used sensor sites. Using fragrance free moisturizer designed for sensitive skin can further reduce the likelihood of irritation. After removing your sensor, make sure to continue keeping the area hydrated, and consider applying thicker moisturizers, such as Vaseline or Aquaphor for extra protection.

## 2. Consider Allergy Medications
Using over-the-counter steroids such as hydrocortisone or Flonase can also reduce the itchiness of the sensor site. If using Flonase, after cleansing the sensor site, spray the site once or twice, and then wait for the site to dry before applying the sensor. If using hydrocortisone, apply a thin layer to the irritated area once or twice a day until the irritation subsides. You can also lightly apply hydrocortisone to the sensor site before applying the sensor as a protective measure.

## 3. Use Skin Barrier Treatments
Skin barrier treatments are over the counter wipes sprays that create a film on your skin, or physical barriers that prevent the adhesives from making direct contact with your skin. Popular spray/wipe brands include 3M Cavillon, Skin Tac, and Skin Glu. Spray/wipe the sensor site after cleansing, wait for the treatment to dry, and apply the sensor. For physical barrier patches, cut a hole in the middle of the patch and apply it to the skin, and attach the sensor in the middle. Popular brands of physical barriers include Tegaderm, IV3000, and hydrocolloid bandages from band aid manufacturers.

## 4. Skip the Alcohol Swab
Alcohol can excessively dry the skin and make irritation more likely. Instead of clearing with an alcohol solution, wash the sensor site with antimicrobial soap and water, and dry thoroughly.
