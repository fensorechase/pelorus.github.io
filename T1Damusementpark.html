							# Four Tips for Amusement Park Success:
							#### Author: Anjali Prabhakaran

							Amusement park days are one of the best parts of summer. Between roller coasters and park treats, what’s not to love? Unfortunately, they can also be crowded, hectic, and busy, making it stressful when managing your diabetes. Here are some tips that I’ve found helpful when planning a long day at a park!
							

							
							## 1. Pack All of Your Supplies - and then some!
							Preparation is the key to success, so I always like to pack my medical supply bag the night before, when I’m clear headed and not in a rush. If you use insulin injections, be sure to bring a few more than you need for the day. I would also recommend bringing a few snacks in case of low blood sugar, and packing a water bottle with you to stay hydrated throughout the day. This way, you don’t have to be worried about getting stuck in long lines for water fountains or restaurants!
							
							## 2. Carry a Doctor’s Note
							Most amusement parks will have a mandatory bag search. The searches are mainly to assure that new visitors don't bring in any weapons, but some amusement parks also have restrictions on liquids, food, etc. that can be brought in. To make sure you can bring in all of your supplies, I recommend having a doctor’s note with you. I usually ask my doctor to write a letter describing my medical condition, indicate what supplies I need on hand at all times, and print it on the hospital letterhead. I use this letter at airports, amusement parks, concert venues, etc. This way, I’m always prepared if any questions arise.
							
							## 3. Get a Medical Tag
							Most amusement parks have restrictions on what bags you can bring with you once you enter a line for a ride. If you want to have your bag with you at all times, in case of any unexpected delays in the line, go to the visitors center immediately after you enter the park to get a medical tag. I usually explain my situation and show the employee my medical letter. Then, I attach a tag to my bag, and I show the medical tag when I get in line and at any checkpoints during the line. At the beginning of the ride, I hand my bag to an employee who keeps it with them, and when I get off the ride I can pick up my bag again. This way, I’m as close as possible to all of my medical supplies and always prepared.
							
							## 4. Disconnect your Pump While on Rides
							Due to the powerful magnets used on many rides, as well as the high gravitational forces you experience, insulin pumps and CGMs may not work as reliably. Keep this in mind and make sure to check and double check all of your devices frequently! If you use a pump, it is recommended you disconnect it while on the ride or just use injections for the day. However, as always, make sure to consult your doctor before making any changes to your management!
