# Hospital Coping
#### Author: Anjali Prabhakaran

If you have T1D, chances are you’ve spent a few nights in the hospital at one time or another. Being in the hospital is hard - apart from the difficult circumstances that brought you there, you’re away from your regular life, your own bed, and often surrounded by relentlessly beeping machines and chaos. I’ve been in those shoes more times than I’d care to admit, but along the way, I’ve picked up a few tips to make this experience slightly more comfortable. 

## 1. Take a Walk 
When you’re stuck in a hospital room for hours or days on end, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and stressed. When I start to feel this way, I try to leave my room for a bit. If I’m connected to an IV or other monitors, I’ll ask my nurses if I can be disconnected so that I can take a short walk. I’ve also taken my IV pole with me if I have to stay hooked up. I’ll take a few laps around the lobby of the hospital, step outside for some fresh air, people watch, and wander the gift shop. When I return to my room, I’m always slightly more rejuvenated than when I left.

## 2. Take a Shower
Nothing feels ickier than lying in a hospital bed all day! If you are able to take one, a shower is a quick way to feel refreshed and energized. If you’re not able to take a full shower, taking a wet paper towel to clean your body is another alternative. If that feels like too much, then try washing your face, or just changing into fresh clothes. I find that maintaining some sort of hygiene routine keeps me feeling like myself.

## 3. Stay Busy!
The enemy of despair is staying occupied. If you have a TV in your room or your computer with you, watch a movie or start a new show! Most pediatric wards also have resource rooms where they have books, board games, and movies to borrow. If you have a library card, some libraries also have options to rent e-books or PDF copies online. I know this is the least fun option, but you can also work on school assignments or work projects. Keeping yourself entertained and occupied is a great way to pass the time.

## 4. Call Your Friends and Family
Ultimately, being in the hospital can be incredibly isolating. When I start to feel lonely, I text my friends or family and ask if they have time for a quick call. Talking to my loved ones almost immediately brightens my mood. They listen when I need to complain or vent, help me make fun plans for when I’m discharged, and keep me grounded. When my admission starts to feel endless, these conversations remind me of the full and happy life that I have outside of hospital that I can return to soon enough.
